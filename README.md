## Hi there 👋
💫 About Me:
Hi, I'm Dev Pratap Srivastava — a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building scalable, production-ready web applications. 
I work primarily with React, Next.js, and Node.js, focusing on creating responsive interfaces and robust backend logic. I have designed and deployed full-stack applications like CareerBuilderz, implementing secure authentication (RBAC), RESTful APIs, and optimizing database queries for performance. 
Beyond writing code, I care about reliability and deployment — utilizing GitHub CI/CD pipelines and platforms like Vercel and Supabase to ship efficient software. I also have experience with UI development and Agile practices through virtual simulations at J.P. Morgan. 

With a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and OOP, I am constantly sharpening my problem-solving skills. I have solved 150+ problems on LeetCode and actively participate in hackathons like the EY Hackathon 5.0. 
I enjoy solving hard problems, mentoring peers in web development, and contributing to collaborative coding initiatives.
